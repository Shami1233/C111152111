# Group Homework Project

This repository is for the group homework assigned in our course. The group members are responsible for different parts of the project, and we are using GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## Group Members
- **C110152338**
- **C110196130**
- **C110152310**
- **C110152319**

## Homework Details
Each group member is responsible for a specific section of the project. The tasks are developed in individual branches and merged into the main repository. The goal is to collaboratively solve any merge conflicts and ensure the final version is polished and error-free.

## Workflow
1. **Fork** the repository created by the lecturer.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a **branch** for your assigned task.
4. Develop and commit your changes on your branch.
5. **Merge** your changes into the main repository.
6. **Handle Merge Conflicts** if they arise and ensure everything is properly synchronized.
7. Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** for the lecturer to review.

## Testing & Merging
To facilitate conflict testing, a **conflict folder** was added to simulate and handle merge conflicts.

### To Do
- Review and resolve any remaining merge conflicts.
- Ensure that all files are up to date and tested before the final submission.
